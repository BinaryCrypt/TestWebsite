        <p>The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat,
             is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China.
              This bear also has a special significance for WWF because it has been our logo since our founding in 1961.</p>
        <p>Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China,
             where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day,
              depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.</p>
        <p>A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th the size of its mother—but females can grow up to about 200 pounds,
             while males can grow up to about 300 pounds as adults. These bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk.</p>

        <h1>Facts</h1>
        <hr><br>
        <p>The largest bear in the world and the Arctic's top predator, polar bears are a powerful symbol of the strength and endurance of the Arctic.
             The polar bear's Latin name, Ursus maritimus, means "sea bear." It's an apt name for this majestic species, which spends much of its life in, around,
              or on the ocean-predominantly on the sea ice. In the United States, Alaska is home to two polar bear subpopulations.</p>
         <p>Considered talented swimmers, polar bears can sustain a pace of six miles per hour by paddling with their front paws and holding their hind legs flat like a rudder.
                   They have a thick layer of body fat and a water-repellent coat that insulates them from the cold air and water.</p>
        <p>Polar bears spend over 50% of their time hunting for food. A polar bear might catch only one or two out of 10 seals it hunts, depending on the time of year and other variables.
                        Their diet mainly consists of ringed and bearded seals because they need large amounts of fat to survive.</p>
        <p>Polar bears rely heavily on sea ice for traveling, hunting, resting, mating and, in some areas,
             maternal dens. But because of ongoing and potential loss of their sea ice habitat resulting from climate change-the primary threat to polar bears Arctic-wide-polar bears were listed as a threatened species in
              the US under the Endangered Species Act in May 2008.
              As their sea ice habitat recedes earlier in the spring and forms later in the fall, polar bears are increasingly spending longer periods on land, where they are often attracted to areas where humans live.</p>
        <p>The survival and the protection of the polar bear habitat are urgent issues for WWF.
             In October 2019, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Polar Bear Specialist Group released a new assessment of polar bear populations showing that the number of polar bear subpopulations experience recent declines has increased to four,
              with eight populations still being data-deficient.
             The good news is that five populations are stable while two have been experiencing an upward trend.</p>

        <h1>Facts</h1>
        <br><hr>
        <p>There are two recognized subspecies of tiger*: the continental (<i>Panthera tigris tigris</i>) and the Sunda (<i>Panthera tigris sondaica</i>).
             The largest of all the Asian big cats, tigers rely primarily on sight and sound rather than smell for hunting. They typically hunt alone and stalk prey.
              A tiger can consume more than 80 pounds of meat at one time. On average, tigers give birth to two to four cubs every two years.
             If all the cubs in one litter die, a second litter may be produced within five months.</p>
        <p>Tigers generally gain independence at around two years of age and attain sexual maturity at age 
                 three or four for females and four or five years for males.Juvenile mortality is high,
                  however—about half of all cubs do not survive more than two years.
                  Tigers have been known to reach up to 20 years of age in the wild.</p>
        <p>Males of the larger subspecies, the continental tiger, may weigh up to 660 pounds.
                       For males of the smaller subspecies—the Sunda tiger—the upper range is at around 310 pounds.
                       Within both subspecies, males are heavier than females.</p>
        <p>Tigers are mostly solitary, apart from associations between mother and offspring. Individual tigers have a large territory,
             and the size is determined mostly by the availability of prey.
             Individuals mark their domain with urine, feces, rakes, scrapes, and vocalizing.</p>
        <p>Across their range, tigers face unrelenting pressures from poaching, retaliatory killings, and habitat loss.
             They are forced to compete for space with dense and often growing human populations.</p>

        <h1>Facts</h1>
        <br><hr>
        <p>Rhinos once roamed many places throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa and were known to early Europeans who depicted them in cave paintings.
             At the beginning of the 20th century, 500,000 rhinos roamed Africa and Asia. By 1970, rhino numbers dropped to 70,000, and today
             , around 27,000 rhinos remain in the wild. Very few rhinos survive outside national parks and reserves due to persistent poaching and habitat loss over many decades. Three species of rhino—black, Javan, and Sumatran—are critically endangered.
              Today, a small population of Javan rhinos is found in only one national park on the northern tip of the Indonesian island of Java. A mainland subspecies of the Javan rhino was declared extinct in Vietnam in 2011.
               Successful conservation efforts have led to an increase in the number of greater one-horned (or Indian) rhinos, from around 200 at the turn of the 20th century to around 3,700 today.
              The greater one-horned rhino is one of Asia's biggest success stories, with their status improving from endangered to vulnerable following significant population increases. However,
             the species still remains under threat from poaching for its horn and from habitat loss and degradation.</p>
        <p>In Africa, southern white rhinos, once thought to be extinct, now thrive in protected sanctuaries and are classified as near threatened.
             But the western black rhino and northern white rhinos have recently become extinct in the wild. The only two remaining northern white rhino are kept under 24-hour guard in Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya.
              Black rhinos have doubled in number over the past two decades from their low point of fewer than 2,500 individuals,
             but total numbers are still a fraction of the estimated 100,000 that existed in the early part of the 20th century.</p>
